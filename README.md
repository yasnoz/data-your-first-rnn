This introductory exercise will get you familiar with temporal data.

Your goal will be to **predict a salary on the 11th year based on the salaries of the past 10 years**.

Thanks to this basic example, you will easily code your first Recurrent Neural Network.

## A Note on Google Colab

For this challenge, you don't need to use Google Colab. There will be **no performance gains** from using it, as today's machines are powerful enough to tackle this challenge — especially if you're on a MacBook with an M1 or newer chip! 😉

Proceed with the challenge as you normally would with Jupyter Notebook (❌ Do not use Colab ❌)

Good luck! 🚀
